# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
My Master's Degree final project, predicting the likelihood for a customer to churn, based on data from a fictional telecommunications company, Telco.

## Tools and Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, SciPy Stats, GridSearchCV, Pipeline, SMOTENC, Random Forest Classifier, 
Logistic Regression Classifier, Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGB), Scaled Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, Confusion Matrix,
Precision Recall Curve

## Project Structure

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Run notebooks in order

## Results
Using a hyperparameter-tuned logistic regression model with SMOTENC applied, I achieved an 84% class 1 recall score, .8815 ROC-AUC score, and classified 
only 4.33% False Negatives (61) in a confusion matrix of 808 True Negatives, 61 False Negatives, 313 True Positives, and 227 False Positives. The full 
results will be in the "Results" section of the Word Document.
